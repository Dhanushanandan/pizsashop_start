        explanation="Providing an `inputType` attribute on a text field improves usability because depending on the data to be input, optimized keyboards can be shown to the user (such as just digits and parentheses for a phone number). &#xA;&#xA;The lint detector also looks at the `id` of the view, and if the id offers a hint of the purpose of the field (for example, the `id` contains the phrase `phone` or `email`), then lint will also ensure that the `inputType` contains the corresponding type attributes.&#xA;&#xA;If you really want to keep the text field generic, you can suppress this warning by setting `inputType=&quot;text&quot;`."
